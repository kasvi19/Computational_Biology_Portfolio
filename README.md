# Computational_Biology_Portfolio
 Projects showcasing bioinformatics and computational biology skills.
    Repository Structure
    #1 Bioinformatics_Tools/
        Contains standalone Python scripts for common bioinformatics tasks, such as sequence analysis, GC content calculation, and sequence alignment.

    #2 Data_Analysis/
        Includes processed datasets and visualization outputs generated during analysis, such as amino acid frequency charts and sliding window GC plots.

    #3 Mathematical_Models/
        Will house implementations of simple mathematical models related to biological processes (to be added in future iterations).

    #4 Sample_Data/
        Contains example input files, such as FASTA files, and corresponding outputs for testing and validation of the tools.

    #5 Notebooks/
        Jupyter Notebooks that integrate multiple scripts and provide end-to-end workflows for analyzing biological data or exploring datasets.
